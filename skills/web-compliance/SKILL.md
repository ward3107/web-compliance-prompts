name: web-compliance
description: >
  Generates filled-in, ready-to-paste AI coding prompts for website legal
  compliance in a chosen jurisdiction. Use this skill ANY TIME the user asks
  for a compliance prompt, legal page, cookie banner, accessibility widget,
  privacy policy, freelancer contract, terms of use, refund policy, disclaimer,
  e-commerce checkout, email marketing, GDPR or data-subject-rights layer, or
  client onboarding form — even casually ("give me the cookie banner", "I need
  a privacy policy prompt", "freelancer contract please"). Always ask which
  markets the site serves, then which language, then the variables, then output
  the filled prompt. Ships jurisdiction packs for Israel (Privacy Protection
  Law Amendment 13 · IS 5568) and the EU/EEA (GDPR · ePrivacy · EAA /
  EN 301 549 · WCAG 2.1 AA), plus GTM Consent Mode v2 wiring.

# Web Compliance — Prompt Generator

Turns a compliance artifact (cookie banner, privacy policy, accessibility
widget…) plus one or more jurisdictions into a fully filled-in prompt, ready to
paste into Cursor, Claude Code or any AI coding assistant.

The design separates two things:

- **`templates/`** — WHAT to build. Jurisdiction-neutral.
- **`jurisdictions/`** — WHICH rules apply, with citations and review dates.

You compose them. One `cookie-banner` template serves Israel, the EU and
California without being forked.

## ⚠️ Not legal advice

These prompts and the documents they generate are **templates for informational
purposes only** and do **not** constitute legal advice. Laws change and every
situation differs. Before publishing any policy, contract, disclaimer, or
accessibility statement produced with this skill, have it reviewed by a
qualified lawyer licensed in the relevant jurisdiction. Use at your own risk;
no warranty is provided.

Both shipped jurisdiction packs are currently marked `needs_legal_review: true`
— they have not yet been signed off by a lawyer. Say so if the user seems to be
relying on them as authoritative.

---

## Workflow (follow every time)

1. **Identify the artifact** the user wants (match by name or description).
2. **Ask which markets the site serves** — this is the jurisdiction question and
   it comes FIRST, because it changes the legal requirements, not just wording.
   Offer: Israel / EU-EEA / UK / United States (ask which states) / a
   combination. If they name a market with no pack yet (Canada, Australia,
   Brazil, or a US state other than California), say plainly there is no pack, that
   you can still generate the artifact using the closest pack, and that a local
   lawyer must review it.
3. **Ask for the output language** — Hebrew / Arabic / English / Russian.
4. **Ask for the variables** for that artifact (see below). All at once, grouped
   naturally. Mark optional fields as (optional).
5. **Read the template** from `templates/` and the pack(s) from
   `jurisdictions/`.
6. **Compose and output** — replace every `[BRACKET]`, set `[JURISDICTIONS]` to
   the chosen markets, and fill `== LANGUAGE ==`. Fold in the requirements from
   each selected pack.
   - If two packs **conflict**, do NOT silently pick one. Apply the stricter
     rule and surface the conflict — each pack lists known conflicts under
     `conflicts:`.
   - Cite the governing law by name in the generated output, so whoever reviews
     it can check the source.

## Jurisdiction Packs

| Pack | Covers | Consent model |
|---|---|---|
| `jurisdictions/il.yaml` | Privacy Protection Law + Amendment 13, IS 5568 (WCAG 2.0 AA), accessibility, spam, contracts | opt-in |
| `jurisdictions/eu.yaml` | GDPR, ePrivacy Art. 5(3), EAA / EN 301 549 (WCAG 2.1 AA), Web Accessibility Directive | opt-in |
| `jurisdictions/uk.yaml` | UK GDPR + DPA 2018, PECR (cookies + marketing, incl. soft opt-in), Equality Act, public-sector accessibility regs | opt-in |
| `jurisdictions/us.yaml` | Federal layer only: CAN-SPAM, COPPA, ADA, Section 508 | opt-out |
| `jurisdictions/us-ca.yaml` | CCPA/CPRA, Global Privacy Control, CPPA — `extends: us` | opt-out |

Things to get right when several apply:

- **The cookie banner comes from ePrivacy / PECR, not the GDPR.** GDPR (and UK
  GDPR) supplies the definition of valid consent; ePrivacy Art. 5(3) in the EU
  and PECR Reg. 6 in the UK are what require prior consent before any device
  storage — localStorage and fingerprinting included, not just cookies.
- **Consent models are opposite across markets.** EU / UK / Israel are opt-in
  (consent before storage). US states are opt-out (a "Do Not Sell or Share"
  control). Geo-detect and serve each visitor their own model. Never apply the
  US opt-out model globally — that breaches ePrivacy and PECR.
- **Honour Global Privacy Control wherever US state law applies.** It is a code
  requirement (`navigator.globalPrivacyControl`), not policy text, and it
  applies even on a site that otherwise runs an opt-in banner.
- **Email consent differs sharply.** CAN-SPAM permits sending until opt-out;
  EU / UK / Israel require prior opt-in. One list spanning them must be opt-in.
- **Build accessibility to WCAG 2.1 AA.** IS 5568 is based on 2.0 AA, but the
  EAA and the UK public-sector regs require EN 301 549 → 2.1 AA. 2.1 is a
  superset, so it satisfies both.
- **`us.yaml` alone is never "US compliant".** There is no general federal
  privacy law; consumer rights come from state packs. If the user names a state
  with no pack, say so plainly rather than implying coverage.
